Description: This README must detail the information necessary to understand
the associated project 2. 

Main Body:
	These are the associated files of proj2:
	1 - system call headers: /usr/src/project2/include/linux/syscalls.h, bottom 
		of the file
	2 - system call definitions: /usr/src/project2/proj2/mssgBox.c
	3 - system call makefile : /usr/src/project2/proj2/Makefile
	
	The system call makfile is linked to the kernel makefile here:
		/usr/src/project2/Makefile
		
	Inside arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl, we add our project 2 system 
	calls to the syscall table. 

Citations:
	Only sources included in the project 2 webpage were used for this portion
	of the project.

Rought Draft One: Build prototype.
	After studying the userspace versions list.h and list_hack.h, I was really
	concerned that I did not understand the way the userspace prototype was
	supposed to be coded. After speaking with the Tutor at the Computer Success
	Center, I have decided to just implement the mail box system like normal. 
	Forget developing the system calls for the kernel and then modifying them
	for userspace. Just Dev in C89/90, constrain your linked list to 
	list.h/list_hack.h, and just get the idea/algorithms right. Get some 
	momentum going. Unable to speak with the course TA on discord. 
	
	Move kernel style header and c file to the proj2 folder. Start over with C. 
	

Rough Draft Zero: Build the prototype.
	Template downloaded.
	First build of kernel completed.
	Proj2proto & proj2test directories set up. 
	
	Plan: The contents of the two directories above will work together to allow
	for testing of the prototype. Inside Proj2proto will be the anticipated
	pseudo system calls, written in c89 (all variables declared at the top, no 
	"//comments"). Inside proj2test will reside the driver files that will call
	the psuedo system call in proj2proto
