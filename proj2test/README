Description: this README must detail the testing and verification regimine of 
	the system calls implemented for project 2, Section 99, CMSC 421 OS, UMBC,
	in the Spring Semester of 2021. 
	
Main Body: 
	The testing driver file : testMssgBox.c
	makefile: Makefile
	primary make command: "make all" 
	make return/executable : test_mbox
	
	Upon execution of test_mbox, ie. "./test_mbox"
	a user menu will appear, detailing the options available to the tester.
	These should include the following:
		1 - Create mailbox
		2 - Delete mailbox
		3 - Reset mailbox stand
		4 - Count the mailboxes
		5 - Return a list of mailboxes
		6 - Send a message 
		7 - Receive a message
		8 - Peek at a message
		9 - Count the messages
		10 - Query length of message
		11 - Print all mssgs in one mailbox
	
Testing Driver Implementation:
	file: testMssgBox.c
	
	The driver will take many details from the testing and validation 
	arrangment seen in proj2proto/src/proto.c
	
	The primary difference will be the import of system calls. Helper functions
	to prepare user input and evaluate system call returns will be defined
	insided the testing driver.
